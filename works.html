      <h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
      <p>When Elizabeth Bennet meets eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy,
        she thinks him arrogant and conceited; he is indifferent to her good looks
        and lively mind. When she later discovers that Darcy has involved himself
        in the troubled relationship between his friend Bingley and her beloved
        sister Jane, she is determined to dislike him more than ever. In the
        sparkling comedy of manners that follows, Jane Austen shows the folly of
        judging by first impressions and superbly evokes the friendships, gossip
        and snobberies of provincial middle-class life.</p>

      <h3>Persuasion</h3>
      <p>At twenty-Â­seven, Anne Elliot is no longer young and has few romantic prospects.
        Eight years earlier, she had been persuaded by her friend Lady Russell to break
        off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, a handsome naval captain with neither
        fortune nor rank. What happens when they encounter each other again is movingly
        told in Jane Austen's last completed novel.</p>

      <h3>Mansfield Park</h3>
      <p>Taken from the poverty, Fanny Price is brought up with her rich cousins at Mansfield Park,
        acutely aware of her humble rank and with her cousin Edmund as her sole ally.
        During her uncle's absence in Antigua, the Crawford's arrive in the neighbourhood
        bringing with them the glamour of London life and a reckless taste for flirtation. Mansfield
        Park is considered Jane Austen's first mature work and, with its quiet heroine
        and subtle examination of social position and moral integrity, one of her most
        profound.</p>

      <p>Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love
        with the dashing John Willoughby she ignores her sister
        Elinor's warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip.
        Meanwhile Elinor is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment.
        The sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find
        personal happiness. </p>

      <h3>Emma</h3>
      <p>Beautiful and clever Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content
        with her life and sees no need for love or marriage. Nothing,
        however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others.
        But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knightley and
        attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her
        carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never
        expected.Emma is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.

      <h3>Northanger Abbey</h3>
      <p>During an eventful season at Bath, young, naive Catherine Morland
        experiences the joys of fashionable society for the first time. She is
        delighted with her new acquaintances: flirtatious Isabella, who shares
        Catherine's love of Gothic romance and horror, and sophisticated Henry
        and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father's mysterious house,
        Northanger Abbey. There, her imagination influenced by novels of sensation
        and intrigue, Catherine imagines terrible crimes committed by General Tilney.
        With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, this is the most youthful
        and and optimistic of Jane Austen's works.</p>
