  <p>
    Jane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which
    interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of
    the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on
    marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security.
    Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th
    century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.
    Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary,
    have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences
    alike.
